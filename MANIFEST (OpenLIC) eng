OpenLIC

OpenLIC is a license created by me (SlitherPapa), to facilitate the use and moderation of my source code. If an application has the phrase "OpenLIC", it means you can modify and use the source code:

OpenLIC OpenLICenCe by SlitherPapa (2022)

To use fonts (source code / .AiA) with OpenLIC license, agree to use the terms of the font.

The font can be used as restrictions, following the regrets:

Use for your own property
-Always inform me (SlitherPapa) of near-changes (composition file / changes without source code) **
-Me post/package info based on my source in "Pull Requests" here on Github
-Tell me about changes about my code's best/fixes in the "Issues" section here on Github
-You can modify the way you want, adding buttons, texts, etc, but always informing the source of the base code, which is the next case, it's me
-Place source of modified place with the application .AIA / Package compiled from my source the SlitherPapa with my name in any application (Normalee natura credits)

You can use this license with your applications called "MANIFEST (OpenLIC)" and together with correction/modification of my applications/sources.
This is a way of certification to know the source of my applications under the OpenLIC license (as the name implies, it can be used as a license for distributions that
had a font based on my project, that is, it can be openly used as a license to use)

** To be informed about permitted usage, write a comment on my Youtube channel here on GitHub about "issues"
