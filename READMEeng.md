## License
OpenLIC or OLlsp (OpenLic licence SlitherPapa)

OpenLIC is a license created by me (SlitherPapa), to facilitate the permitted and moderate use of my source code. If an app contains the phrase "OpenLIC" it means that you can modify and use the source code:

OpenLIC OpenLICenCe by SlitherPapa (2022)

By using fonts (source code/.AiA) with OpenLIC license, you agree to accept the terms of use for the font.

The font can be used without restrictions, following rules:

- Use for own use
- Always inform me (SlitherPapa) of any changes (compiled package/Source code changes)**
- Notify me of posts/packages based on my source in "Pull Requests" here on Github
- Notify me of changes about improvements/fixes to my code in the "Issues" part here on Github
- You can modify the way you want, adding buttons, texts, etc, but always informing the source of the base code, which in this case is mine
- Put together with the modified .AIA/source compiled package from my source the MANIFEST with my name (SlitherPapa) anywhere in the
 app (Usually in the credits part)

You can use this license in your apps by downloading the "MANIFEST (OpenLIC)" and putting it together with the package/modification of my apps/source or by embedding the content of the manifest in any part of credits (Example: About Screen). This is a form of certification to know that you are using the source of my apps under the OpenLIC license (As the name says, it can be used as a license for distributions that had the source based on my project, that is, it can be openly used as a license to use)

** To report a permitted use, please write a comment on my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo1NPKKzSMoy8pGHMAWsm7Q) channel or here on GitHub in the "issues" part

## Updates
This application may receive updates both visually and on its use. You can regularly visit my website to check for any updates.

## Creation
The app was developed with an IDE called Kodular, which is a great low-code, I recommend using it.
Full Kodular Credits!

Ready!

## Download .AIA
You are free to download and modify (following the rules of the OpenLIC) Slither Papa Browser or Slither Papa Password Generator

Remembering that the app is my authorship, that is, if you copy it, you can receive "Strike". You can get inspiration from the app, either by creating a better version and publishing it in the "issues" section or submitting a "Pull Request" here on GitHub.

As you can see, the file is in ".slitheraia", which was a form of security of mine for distribution, but you can rename it later to ".aia".

To download, do the same process as you did to download the applications, only paying attention to download the ".slitheraia".
